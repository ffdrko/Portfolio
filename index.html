            <p style="text-align: justify">
              I graduated from North South University with a Bachelor of Science
              in Computer Science and Engineering. During my academic career, I
              participated in various projects, such as developing a website for
              a startup base and developing a model to predict the car crash. I
              was also the second runner-up in the Innovation Challenge and was
              selected at the primary level in the Mujib 100 Ideas competition.
              I was the general secretary of the Engineering Club during my
              university years, where I was responsible for organizing events
              and activities for the club members and helping to raise funds for
              the club. I interned as an IT Business Analyst at a local company,
              where I was responsible for gathering and analyzing data to help
              the company make better business decisions. I am a hard-working
              and motivated individual with a strong academic background and a
              passion for computer science. I am confident that I can contribute
              to your team and help you achieve your goals.

                  Our Database Management System course project is a web application designed to assist travelers in finding information about places they want to visit. Users can sign in and input their starting point and destination, and the software provides them with the shortest and easiest route. Users can also contribute information, rate existing data, and earn points as guides. When guides accumulate enough points, they can convert them into real money. Users and guides can report issues, and the admin manages the database. Additionally, there's a FAQ section for common queries.

                  The project aims to provide travelers with valuable information about destinations and transportation options, enhancing their travel experiences. Although some features like notifications and money withdrawal remain to be implemented, we plan to incorporate them in the future.

                  As automobile accidents rise, demand for high-performance collision detection systems rises. We offer a car crash              detection system that employs dashboard camera video. Different data. The proposed vehicle collision detection system              leverages an ensemble of information sources (e.g., dashboard cameras) to identify collisions.Multi-modal deep              learning (i.e., both videos). These different viewpoints complement one other and improve detection since one view may               contain knowledge the other doesn't. The proposed vehicle collision detection system will beat existing technologies,             according to experiments. 80% of  we trained and tested our model using the repository. Through testing and tuning,              the model could identify accidents quickly and with 90% accuracy. The prediction method underperformed for numerous              reasons. Dataset limitations. This method might have a substantial socioeconomic and environmental impact and foster innovation.
